## Session Enhancements & Runbook

This runbook documents the key fixes and architecture enhancements implemented during the recent pair-programming sessions. Use this as reference context for debugging or extending the codebase.

### 1. Conversation Explorer Fix (Transcript Loading)
* **Problem**: Selecting a logged conversation in the Dashboard Explorer did not load or display messages in the **Transcript Viewer**. This happened because the client-side dashboard attempted direct queries to the Supabase `messages` table which were blocked by Row Level Security (RLS) policies under the unauthenticated development mode.
* **Solution**:
  - Created a new GET API endpoint at `src/app/api/messages/route.ts` that retrieves transcripts using the Supabase Admin Client (`supabaseAdmin`), bypassing client-side RLS constraints.
  - Updated `src/components/DashboardClient.tsx` to query this API fallback whenever the client-side direct request returns empty or fails.
  - Applied `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` and `Cache-Control: no-store` headers to guarantee dynamic retrieval on demand.

### 2. Chatbot Save & Edit Persistence
* **Problem**: Editing or creating chatbots via the Dashboard "Edit Persona" form updated the local React state but failed to persist in the database, reverting on page refresh. Client-side browser inserts/updates to the `chatbots` table were blocked by RLS. Furthermore, if client-side environment keys were absent at build-time, the browser client silently mocked success without attempting API requests.
* **Solution**:
  - Created a POST endpoint at `src/app/api/chatbots/route.ts` and a PATCH endpoint at `src/app/api/chatbots/[id]/route.ts` using the Supabase Admin Client to bypass RLS.
  - Modified the dashboard submit handlers in `src/components/DashboardClient.tsx` to **always** route inserts and updates through these secure API endpoints directly.
  - Added cache-busting headers to prevent Next.js from caching GET requests to `/api/chatbots/[id]`.

### 3. Dynamic Welcome Message in Widget
* **Problem**: The chatbot widget loaded the agent's name, avatar, and color, but the greeting message was hardcoded in the template to `"Hello! How can I help you today?"` instead of showing the configured welcome message from the database.
* **Solution**:
  - Updated the public GET endpoint `/api/chatbots/[id]/route.ts` to return the `welcomeMessage` string extracted from the database (`configuration_json.welcome_message`).
  - Modified the widget script `src/widget/index.ts` to dynamically fetch this property from the API response and inject it into the welcome message container in the Shadow DOM.

### 4. Corrected Gemini Streaming Model (Hanging Agent Fix)
* **Problem**: When testing the widget, sending a query caused the typing indicator (3 dots) to loop infinitely, and the chatbot hung. The server logs showed failures inside `src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts` because it attempted to invoke `gemini-3.5-flash`, which is an invalid model name.
* **Solution**:
  - Corrected the model name to `gemini-1.5-flash` in the `streamText` configuration.
  - Pushed the change to GitHub to trigger CI/CD, which successfully resolved the hang.

### 5. Global Branding & Referral Tracking
* **Problem**: Needed a way to watermark all chatbots ("Powered by StyleFlo") and track which clients' websites were referring potential customers back to the StyleFlo landing page, while allowing the global admin to edit this URL and HTML string dynamically.
* **Solution**:
  - Added a "Platform Settings" tab to the Dashboard that saves the global configuration into the `chatbots` table using a reserved UUID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`), avoiding complex schema migrations.
  - Modified the widget config endpoint `/api/chatbots/[id]/route.ts` to fetch and return these global properties.
  - Injected an `<a>` tag at the bottom of the widget (`src/widget/index.ts`) pointing to `/api/track?ref=[chatbot_id]&source=[host]`.
  - Created a new tracking endpoint `/api/track/route.ts` that logs the click into a `referral_clicks` Supabase table before issuing a `302 Redirect` to the global tracking URL.

## Session Chat History Log

### Session 1 (June 16, 2026)
* **User**: "also, the conversation explorer is not populating"
  * **Fix**: Added `/api/messages` endpoint querying with the admin key to bypass RLS policies and integrated it as a fallback in `DashboardClient.tsx`'s message fetching effect.
* **User**: "when editing a bot already built, the save function does not save the details when the dashboard is refreshed, and the widget does not update"
  * **Fix**: Built a backend `PATCH` route at `/api/chatbots/[id]` using the admin key. Configured `handleUpdateChatbot` in the dashboard to route updates through the API.
* **User**: "welcome message is displaying Hello how can i help you today, irespective of what is entered in the app builder"
  * **Fix**: Updated the widget source (`src/widget/index.ts`) and API `/api/chatbots/[id]` to return and render the custom welcome message field.
* **User**: "in the test page, the agent is hanging, with the 3 dots waving"
  * **Fix**: Corrected the chat model in `src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts` from `gemini-3.5-flash` to `gemini-1.5-flash` to resolve the runtime stream API crash.

### Session 2 (June 25, 2026)
* **User**: "link to the google sheet with my backlog in it please"
  * **Fix**: Added direct link to user's Google Sheet project backlog.
* **User**: "supply a copy of the chat that can be appended to each time there is a session, this is so you can refer to it if the session is on a new device"
  * **Fix**: Appended this session chat history log to `README.md`.

### Session 3 (June 26, 2026)
* **User**: "Add a trackable link to the bottom of the free version of the chat bot... When i do want to change the landing page URL Then i must be able to do do this in the admin back office by adding a html entry area... at the end of this session you must update the readme.md file"
  * **Fix**: Implemented the "Platform Settings" tab in the dashboard. Forced the widget to pull this global config and display an HTML footer. Setup an `/api/track` route to log to `referral_clicks` table and redirect to the customizable landing page. Updated README.md.
* **User**: "lets fix the bug that is stopping the transcript from loading in the transcript viewer / conversation explorer"
  * **Fix**: Re-architected `fetchMessages` in `DashboardClient.tsx` to be API-first. It now queries the secure backend `/api/messages` endpoint directly, bypassing RLS constraints and resolving blank screens when the client-side `supabase` browser client is null (uninitialized).
